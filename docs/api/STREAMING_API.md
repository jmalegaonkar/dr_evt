# C++ Streaming API Reference

## Overview

The DR_EVT simulator provides a streaming API that allows external code (e.g., gRPC servers - see [gRPC Client/Server Guide and API](../CLIENT_SERVER_GUIDE.md), workflow managers) to feed jobs dynamically and control simulation time advancement. This enables online/incremental simulation where jobs arrive over time rather than all at once.

Batch mode loads a trace and completes it with `run()`. Streaming mode adds
new jobs with `append_job()` or `append_jobs()` and lets the caller advance
simulation time. `advance_to(t)` includes events at `t`;
`run_until_exclusive(t)` excludes them.

## C++ Development API Reference

These are direct methods on `dr_evt::Simulation`; they do not require a
server or gRPC. The gRPC service maps its request messages onto these methods
where applicable; see the [Client/Server Guide](../CLIENT_SERVER_GUIDE.md) for
the wire protocol.

For live jobs, `append_job()` (or `append_jobs()`) creates a new
job and enqueues it atomically for scheduling.

### `initialize_trace(max_jobs = 0)`

Loads trace data and prepares it for either batch or streaming use: sorts jobs by submit time and determines actual durations (simulation mode only).

```cpp
num_jobs_t initialize_trace(num_jobs_t max_jobs = 0);
```

**Parameters:**
- `max_jobs`: Maximum number of jobs to load (0 = no limit)

**Returns:** number of jobs actually loaded

Call this before `advance_to()`. Calling `get_trace().load_data()` directly
skips sorting and duration determination. The method is idempotent and clears
loaded data before reinitializing it.

**Example:**
```cpp
Simulation sim(params);
num_jobs_t num_jobs = sim.initialize_trace();
std::cout << "Loaded " << num_jobs << " jobs\n";
```

### `append_job(submit_time, num_nodes, queue, limit_time)`

Adds a genuinely new job - one the trace has never seen before - to the
job store and immediately enqueues it for scheduling. This is how a job the
caller learns about live (for example, from a network event) enters a
streaming simulation.

```cpp
job_no_t append_job(sim_time_t submit_time, num_nodes_t num_nodes,
                     const std::string& queue, tdiff_t limit_time);
```

**Parameters:**
- `submit_time`: When the job is submitted (must be >= current_time)
- `num_nodes`: Number of nodes the job requests
- `queue`: Numeric queue ID (for example, `"1"`) in the default build, or a
  queue name (for example, `"pbatch"`) with `DR_EVT_LEGACY_QUEUE_INPUT`
- `limit_time`: User-estimated time limit, in seconds

**Returns:** the new job's `job_no`

**Example:**
```cpp
job_no_t j = sim.append_job(10.0, 20, "1", 200.0);
sim.advance_to(10.0);
```

### `append_jobs(requests)`

The batch counterpart to `append_job()` - several new jobs in one call,
each as a `Job_Append_Request` (the same four fields `append_job()`
takes, grouped). Resolves job-store capacity once for the whole batch
rather than once per job, so it's the more efficient choice when several
jobs are already known together (e.g. several arrivals collected in one
polling interval), not just a loop over `append_job()`. All-or-nothing:
requests must already be sorted by `submit_time` (non-decreasing), and
either the whole batch is appended or, on any failure (unsorted input,
`--job_store_overflow=abort` with no room even after reclaiming, or
`--check_memory_pressure` refusing the batch under real memory
pressure - see [Command-Line Options](../user-guide/command-line.md)),
none of it is - `m_data` is never left partially filled.

```cpp
std::vector<job_no_t> append_jobs(const std::vector<Job_Append_Request>& requests);
```

**Parameters:**
- `requests`: the new jobs' own data, in `submit_time` order

**Returns:** each new job's `job_no`, in the same order as `requests`.
All returned jobs are already enqueued for scheduling.

**Example:**
```cpp
std::vector<Simulation::Job_Append_Request> batch = {
    {10.0, 20, "1", 200.0},
    {15.0, 10, "1", 100.0},
};
auto job_nos = sim.append_jobs(batch);
```

### `advance_to(target_time)`

Advances simulation to `target_time` and processes all events at that time.

```cpp
void advance_to(sim_time_t target_time);
```

**Parameters:**
- `target_time`: Time to advance to (must be >= current_time)

**Precondition:** the caller guarantees no job will be submitted with `submit_time < target_time` after this call - either all jobs have already been submitted, or the caller knows the next arrival is at `>= target_time`.

**Behavior:**
- Advances through all events up to AND INCLUDING `target_time`
- Scheduler makes decisions at each event
- Jobs may start/end during advancement
- `current_time` becomes `target_time` after call

**Example:**
```cpp
sim.append_job(0.0, 10, "1", 100.0);
sim.advance_to(0.0);  // Process job 0's START event
// Job 0 is now running

sim.advance_to(100.0);  // Process job 0's END event at t=100
// Job 0 has completed
```

### `flush_completed_jobs()`

Writes and reclaims the completed contiguous front prefix at the simulation's
current time. This provides an explicit output/checkpoint boundary for a long
streaming session without closing the schedule file. Jobs that are unfinished,
still have pending events, or sit behind such a job remain resident.

```cpp
sim.advance_to(checkpoint_time);
sim.flush_completed_jobs();
```

### `run_until_exclusive(target_time)`

Advances simulation to just before `target_time`, excluding events at that exact time.

```cpp
void run_until_exclusive(sim_time_t target_time);
```

**Parameters:**
- `target_time`: Time to advance toward (must be > current_time)

**Behavior:**
- Advances through events BEFORE `target_time`
- Events exactly at `target_time` are NOT processed
- Useful for stopping just before a known event
- `current_time` becomes the last event time < `target_time`

**Example:**
```cpp
sim.append_job(0.0, 10, "1", 100.0);
sim.run_until_exclusive(0.0);  // Does NOT process START event at t=0
// Job 0 is still queued, not running

sim.advance_to(0.0);  // Now process START event
// Job 0 is running
```

### Monitoring Methods

For callback-driven EASY backfilling, construct the simulation with the
custom circular-buffer scheduler:

```cpp
BasicSimulation(const Sim_Params& params, job_cost_function_t cost_function,
                backfill_selector_t selector);
```

Set `params.m_num_max_candidates` before construction. The cost function is
invoked as each job enters the wait queue. The selection function receives up
to that many feasible `(job_id, cost)` pairs and returns one of those IDs, or
`std::nullopt` to decline a backfill.

**Get current simulation time:**
```cpp
sim_time_t get_current_time() const;
```

**Get nodes currently in use / available:**
```cpp
num_nodes_t get_nodes_in_use() const;
num_nodes_t get_available_nodes() const;
double get_current_utilization() const;
tdiff_t get_resource_area() const; // Custom-FCFS simulations only
```

`get_current_utilization()` is the point-in-time ratio of allocated nodes to
configured nodes. For a simulation created with the Custom-FCFS callback
constructor, `get_resource_area()` is the area under the allocated-node curve:
the time integral of allocated nodes, accumulated once per settled scheduling
timestamp and reported in node-seconds. Standard schedulers do not perform
this live bookkeeping, and calling `get_resource_area()` for one throws
`std::logic_error`.

For Custom FCFS, `Statistics::utilization` divides this area by configured
nodes and the elapsed accounting horizon. Standard schedulers retain their
post-hoc completed-schedule utilization calculation.

**Get count of jobs waiting to be scheduled:**
```cpp
size_t get_active_job_count() const;
```

**Get the FCFS-head shadow time:**
```cpp
sim_time_t get_fcfs_head_shadow_time() const;
```

This returns the earliest time at which the current FCFS queue head is
expected to start, based on the scheduler's time-limit reservation model. It
returns `-1` when no job is waiting. It is meaningful for the FCFS/EASY
reservation model.

**Get resource-change times and the matching reservation snapshot:**
```cpp
Simulation::Backfill_Window get_backfill_window() const;
```

```cpp
struct Simulation::Backfill_Window {
    struct Resource_Release {
        sim_time_t time;            // Absolute release time
        num_nodes_t nodes_released; // Nodes becoming free at time
    };

    sim_time_t current_time;              // Snapshot time
    num_nodes_t available_nodes;          // Nodes free immediately
    sim_time_t shadow_time;               // FCFS-head start, or -1 if no head waits
    std::vector<Resource_Release> releases; // Ordered projected releases
};
```

The snapshot contains `current_time`, immediately `available_nodes`, the
same FCFS-head `shadow_time` (`-1` if the queue is empty), and chronologically
ordered resource-change events in `releases`. Each event gives the simulation
`time` at which capacity changes and the summed `nodes_released` then. Events
use time-limit estimates and extend through the reservation; simultaneous
releases are combined. This is an in-process API; it does not require gRPC.

```cpp
auto window = sim.get_backfill_window();
for (const auto& change : window.releases) {
    std::cout << change.time << ": +" << change.nodes_released << " nodes\n";
}
```

**Estimate the Custom-FCFS waiting-queue prediction horizon:**

```cpp
tdiff_t horizon = sim.get_prediction_horizon(utilization);
```

This method is available only for a simulation created with the Custom-FCFS
callback constructor and configured for EASY backfilling. Call it after the
current backfilling cycle completes. At that point, the waiting queue contains
only jobs that could not start, and the running set includes jobs dispatched by
the cycle. The method holds those sets fixed: future arrivals are excluded and
no additional waiting jobs are admitted during its forward replay.

Queued demand is `A_Q = sum(requested_nodes * estimated_runtime)`. Starting at
the FCFS head's shadow time, the method integrates available nodes over each
complete interval between predicted running-job completions and scales that
service area by `utilization`. This factor models capacity loss from
fragmentation and scheduling constraints and is not the instantaneous
utilization at the current scheduling time. Values in `(0, 1]` are used
directly; zero selects the fallback factor `U = 1`.

The method returns the first completion-event offset at which accumulated
usable area covers `A_Q`; it does not interpolate within an intermediate
interval. If the final currently running job completes before the threshold
is reached, the remaining area is converted to time using
`utilization * total_nodes`. An empty queue returns zero.

**Get per-job timing (submission, start, projected end):**

```cpp
Simulation::Job_Timing get_job_timing(job_no_t job_idx) const;
std::vector<Simulation::Job_Timing> get_job_timings(
    const std::vector<job_no_t>& job_idxs) const;
```

These read-only accessors return submission, begin, projected end, time limit,
actual run time, node count, and scheduling state for an appended job. An
unscheduled job has `begin_time` and `end_time` equal to `-1`; its
`submit_time` remains valid unless the job was rejected before scheduling. For
a job that has started, `end_time` is its projected end, equal to start plus
actual run time, which is how dr_evt records job ends.

An unknown or reclaimed job ID raises `std::out_of_range` and includes the ID
in the error. Reclamation can happen when capacity pressure is handled at a
later append or when `flush_completed_jobs()` is called, so a caller that
needs every job's timing must read it before the next append or flush. The
batch accessor preserves request order and throws for the whole request if any
ID is invalid.

```cpp
auto timing = sim.get_job_timing(job_idx);
if (timing.scheduled) {
    std::cout << timing.begin_time << " to " << timing.end_time << "\n";
}
```

**Get scheduling statistics** (wait times, turnaround, utilization):
```cpp
Simulation::Statistics get_statistics() const;
```

**Access trace data:**
```cpp
Trace& get_trace();
const Trace& get_trace() const;
```

## Streaming example

```cpp
while (external_system.has_more_jobs()) {
    Job job = external_system.get_next_job();

    sim.append_job(job.submit_time, job.num_nodes,
                   job.queue, job.limit_time);
    sim.advance_to(job.submit_time);
    std::cout << "Nodes in use: " << sim.get_nodes_in_use() << std::endl;
}
```

For a batch-loaded trace, call `initialize_trace()` followed by `run()`.
Scheduling semantics are documented in
[Scheduling Policies](../BACKFILLING_ALGORITHMS.md), and internal event and
storage ownership in [Job Lifecycle](../dev/JOB_LIFECYCLE.md).

## Testing

The Test Suite README has exact commands for
[streaming and batch-equivalence tests](https://github.com/LLNL/dr_evt/blob/main/tests/README.md#streaming-api-tests)
and
[distributed gRPC and MPI tests](https://github.com/LLNL/dr_evt/blob/main/tests/README.md#distributed-clientserver-tests).
See the runnable
[`test_append_job_api.cpp`](https://github.com/LLNL/dr_evt/blob/main/tests/test_append_job_api.cpp)
and
[`test_batch_vs_streaming.cpp`](https://github.com/LLNL/dr_evt/blob/main/tests/test_batch_vs_streaming.cpp)
for complete C++ call sequences.

## Limitations

1. **No job cancellation**: Once submitted, jobs cannot be cancelled
2. **Time must advance forward**: Cannot go back in time
3. **Single scheduler instance**: In-process coordination of multiple
   schedulers is not supported. Distributed alternatives are described in
   [Client/Server Use Cases](../user-guide/client-server-use-cases.md).
