The sections below define accepted values, defaults, and interactions.

## Basic Usage

```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator INPUT_FILE [OPTIONS]
```

`INPUT_FILE` (the input job trace, in CSV format) can also be given via
`-i, --infile FILENAME` instead of as the first positional argument.

## Input/Output Options

### `-i, --infile FILENAME`
Input job trace file. Can also be specified as the first positional argument.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator --infile traces/jobs.csv
```

### `-L, --infile_list FILENAME`
Path to a file listing multiple trace files, one per line - progressive
loading: each is loaded in turn as the simulation reaches it, so
`--job_store_capacity` can actually bound memory (`--infile`/single-file
mode always grows to fit the whole trace regardless of that setting).
Mutually exclusive with `--infile`/the positional trace-file argument -
do not provide both.

**Requirements:** files must already be sorted by `submit_time`, both
within each file and across the sequence (each file's earliest
`submit_time` must be `>=` the previous file's latest).

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator --infile_list traces/file_list.txt --job_store_capacity 1000
```
where `traces/file_list.txt` contains, one path per line:
```
traces/part1.csv
traces/part2.csv
traces/part3.csv
```

See [`docs/dev/OUTPUT_TRACE_BUFFERS.md`](../dev/OUTPUT_TRACE_BUFFERS.md) for the full design.

### `-o, --outfile FILENAME`
Output file for simulated job trace.

**Default:** Derived from input filename (e.g., `jobs.csv` -> `jobs_sim.csv`)

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --outfile output/result.csv
```

### `--redis_uri URI` and `--redis_key_prefix PREFIX`

Write the simulated-job schedule and resource history to Redis instead of
opening `--outfile` or `--resource_trace`. Both options must be specified, and
DR_EVT must be built with
`-DDR_EVT_WITH_REDIS=ON`.

```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --redis_uri redis://127.0.0.1:6379 \
    --redis_key_prefix dr_evt:run42
```

The key prefix identifies both complete CSV values, per-job hashes, and sorted
search indexes. See [Redis Output](redis-output.md) for installation, server
startup, key layout, and query commands.

### `-R, --resource_trace FILENAME`
Write resource usage trace to file.

When Redis output is enabled, the resource trace is stored at
`<redis_key_prefix>:resources:csv` instead and `FILENAME` is not opened.

The generated schemas are defined in [Output Trace Files](output-traces.md).

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --outfile results/jobs.csv \
    --resource_trace results/resources.csv
```

**Default:** If not specified, resource trace is written to
`<outfile>_resources.csv`, or to `<redis_key_prefix>:resources:csv` when Redis
output is enabled.

## System Configuration

### `-n, --total_nodes COUNT`
Total number of nodes in the simulated cluster.

**Default:** 795

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --total_nodes 100
```

### `--capacity_schedule FILENAME`

Apply a CSV of capacity change points during simulation. See
[Maintenance, Capacity Changes, and Warm Starts](maintenance-and-warm-start.md)
for the schema, semantics, detection tool, and initialization workflow.

`--total_nodes` remains the physical maximum and the oversized-job rejection
threshold. Scheduled values may range from zero through that maximum. A job
that exceeds only the current scheduled capacity waits for a later increase;
it is not rejected. Reductions do not preempt running jobs, and a zero value
pauses all new starts for this workload. A schedule row at time zero replaces
the initial available capacity immediately.

### `--sim_start_time TIME`

Set the global simulation start time to `TIME`. It accepts the same timestamp
forms as trace columns: nonnegative Unix epoch seconds (including fractional
seconds) or a calendar timestamp such as `2024-01-01T00:00:10`. Calendar
values without an embedded UTC offset use `--timezone`. This parsing is
independent of `--timestamp_format`, and option order does not matter.

This global boundary is distinct from each replay job's historical
`begin_time` and from job start times written to output. A positive value
enables the recommended replay-based warm start for replay-format input: jobs
with `begin_time < TIME` bypass the wait queue and seed live occupancy. They retain
their historical departures, but are omitted from job output and job
statistics. Jobs beginning at or after the boundary are rescheduled normally
when their submission is also at or after `TIME`. Zero preserves traditional
full replay.

Only the warm stage tests for historical jobs. After its last departure, the
simulator switches to the ordinary event loop, so the steady-state path has no
per-job warm-start condition. Resource output begins with a baseline at
`TIME`; earlier samples and resource-area accounting are discarded.

Jobs submitted before `TIME` but not yet running are excluded because
reconstructing an inherited wait queue requires an explicit policy. This mode
is currently incompatible with `--infile_list`.

## Scheduling Policies

### `-b, --backfill_policy POLICY`
Backfilling algorithm to use.

**Options:**
- `easy` - EASY backfilling (default): backfill jobs that complete before FCFS head reservation
- `conservative` - Conservative backfilling. Pair with
  `--priority_policy fcfs_conservative` for the full FCFS
  conservative-reservation implementation.
- `none` - Pure FCFS (no backfilling)

**Default:** `easy`

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --backfill_policy conservative
```

### `--num_max_candidates COUNT`

Maximum number of feasible jobs offered to the callback-driven custom
EASY scheduler in one selection decision. `COUNT` must be greater than zero.

**Default:** `1`

The command-line and prototext parsers store this value in `Sim_Params`. The
cost and selection callbacks themselves are installed when constructing the
custom scheduler through the C++ or Python API; they cannot be encoded
in a command-line argument or prototext file.

### `-p, --priority_policy POLICY`
Job priority/ordering policy.

**Options:**
- `fcfs` - First Come First Served (default)
- `fcfs_alt` - Alternative FCFS implementation for differential testing
- `fcfs_conservative` - FCFS implementation that maintains conservative
  reservations; currently uses the `deque` wait queue
- `sjf` - Shortest Job First (by run time estimate)
- `ljf` - Longest Job First (by run time estimate)

**Default:** `fcfs`

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --priority_policy sjf
```

### `-q, --queue_impl IMPLEMENTATION`
Wait queue implementation (FCFS scheduler only).

**Options:**
- `circular` - circular-buffer implementation (default)
- `deque` - sequential deque implementation
- `multimap` - tree-based alternative FCFS implementation
- `block` - block-based implementation; configured by `--block_size`

**Default:** `circular`

**Note:** This option only affects FCFS scheduler. SJF/LJF always use
`std::multimap` (already efficient for priority-based scheduling). If `deque`,
`block`, or `multimap` is specified with SJF/LJF, a warning is printed and the
default `multimap` is used.

Implementation and benchmark details are in
[Wait Queues](../dev/WAIT_QUEUES.md).

### `-Q, --block_size SIZE`
Block size for the `block` wait-queue implementation. Must be a supported
power of two from `4` through `256`. Only used when `--queue_impl=block`.
See [Block Wait Queue](../dev/BLOCK_WAIT_QUEUE.md) for implementation details.

**Default:** `128`

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/large_10k_jobs.csv --priority_policy fcfs --queue_impl block --block_size 64
```

### `-A, --wait_queue_capacity SIZE`
Initial capacity of the circular queue. Only used when `--queue_impl circular`.

**Default:** `0`, meaning the size of the job trace - large enough that the
queue can never overflow, since at most one entry is inserted per job in the
trace over the scheduler's lifetime.

A smaller, explicit value trades that guarantee for a smaller initial
allocation; see `--wait_queue_overflow` for what happens if it's exceeded.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --priority_policy fcfs --queue_impl circular --wait_queue_capacity 1000
```

### `-G, --wait_queue_overflow {abort|grow}`
What to do if an insert would exceed `--wait_queue_capacity`. Only used when
`--queue_impl circular`.

**Options:**
- `abort` - end the simulation with a clean error (`std::runtime_error`,
  reported to stderr / to the gRPC client, exit code 1)
- `grow` (default) - reallocate to double the current capacity via
  `boost::circular_buffer::set_capacity()`, which preserves every existing
  entry; the simulation continues normally

**Default:** `grow`

**Example:**
```bash
# Fail fast if the queue ever needs more than the pre-sized capacity
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --priority_policy fcfs --queue_impl circular \
    --wait_queue_capacity 500 --wait_queue_overflow abort
```

### `-K, --job_store_capacity SIZE`
Initial capacity of the job-record circular buffer. A single-file input is
loaded in full and grows the store if necessary; use progressive loading when
the capacity must bound storage across a larger trace.

**Default:** `0`, meaning the size of the job trace - large enough that the
store can never overflow, since at most one entry is inserted per job.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --job_store_capacity 1000
```

### `-W, --job_store_overflow {abort|grow}`
What to do if an insert would exceed `--job_store_capacity`.

**Options:**
- `abort` - end the simulation with a clean error (`std::runtime_error`,
  reported to stderr / to the gRPC client, exit code 1)
- `grow` (default) - reallocate to a larger capacity, copying every
  existing entry over; the simulation continues normally

**Default:** `grow`

**Example:**
```bash
# Fail fast if the job store ever needs more than the pre-sized capacity
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --job_store_capacity 500 --job_store_overflow abort
```

### `--job_flush_interval RECORDS`

Write and reclaim the completed contiguous front prefix after this many
additional departures. This batches schedule output and reclamation without
checking and removing a record after every completion. Capacity pressure,
`Trace::flush_completed_jobs()`, and final output are independent flush reasons
and reset the interval.

**Default:** `0`, meaning the current job-store circular-buffer capacity. Thus
the default normally waits until space is needed; set a smaller record count to
spread output I/O through a long streaming run.

Setting the interval to `1` attempts a flush after every processed job
departure. Rows remain in permanent job-ID order, so a later backfilled job
that completes before an earlier job is held until the completed records form
a contiguous prefix. The same rule applies to file and Redis output. See
[Redis Output](redis-output.md) for Redis setup and query examples.

### `-m, --check_memory_pressure FRACTION`
Before growing the job-record store for a progressive file or streaming
batch, refuse the operation if projected peak usage would exceed `FRACTION`
of available system memory. This check is independent of
`--job_store_overflow`.

`FRACTION` must be greater than `0.0` and no greater than `1.0`.

On Linux, available memory comes from `/proc/meminfo`'s `MemAvailable`.
The option is a no-op on other platforms and does not account for a
container's effective cgroup limit.

**Default:** disabled

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator --infile_list traces/file_list.txt --check_memory_pressure 0.8
```

See [`docs/dev/OUTPUT_TRACE_BUFFERS.md`](../dev/OUTPUT_TRACE_BUFFERS.md) for the exact formula (mirrors the actual grow-doubling logic, not a fixed multiplier) and rationale.

### `-H, --resource_history_capacity SIZE`
Initial capacity of the resource-history circular buffer. When full, its
finalized records are written to `--resource_trace` and the buffer is cleared.

**Default:** `0`, meaning 2x the number of loaded jobs (large enough it
never needs to reclaim purely to make room) - though never less than
4096, since the loaded count may still be tiny (or 0, early in a
streaming session) at the moment the very first sample is recorded.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --resource_trace resources.csv --resource_history_capacity 10000
```

## Trace Format Options

### `--trace_type TYPE`
Select the job/resource data model independently of the input trace format.

**Options:**
- `standard` - Standard DR_EVT job and resource records (default)
- `pcon` - Experimental records carrying `avgpcon`, `minpcon`, and `maxpcon`

**Default:** `standard`

See [Input Trace Files](trace-formats.md) for required input columns and
[Output Trace Files](output-traces.md) for generated columns.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/pcon.csv \
    --trace_type pcon \
    --trace_format simple \
    --timestamp_format epoch
```

### `-f, --trace_format FORMAT`
Input trace format.

**Options:**
- `simple` - Simple CSV format (minimal columns)
- `lassen` - Lassen HPC format (many metadata columns)

**Default:** `simple`

See [Input Trace Files](trace-formats.md) for both schemas.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/simple.csv --trace_format simple
```

### `-T, --timestamp_format FORMAT`
Retained timestamp-format compatibility setting. The current trace parser
detects numeric epoch seconds or calendar timestamps from the first data row
of each input file and uses that encoding for the rest of the file, regardless
of this setting. Simulated-job and resource-trace output is
numeric in both settings; `--msec_output` controls its precision.

**Options:**
- `epoch`
- `iso`

**Default:** `epoch`

The option currently validates and retains one of these values for API and
configuration compatibility; it does not enforce the input encoding or
select the output encoding. See [Input Trace Files](trace-formats.md) for
accepted timestamp forms.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --timestamp_format epoch
```

### `-z, --timezone TIMEZONE`
Timezone used to interpret calendar timestamps that do not contain an
embedded UTC offset. It does not affect numeric input or simulator output and
does not depend on `--timestamp_format`.

**Format:** IANA or POSIX timezone value understood by the system `TZ`
implementation (e.g., `"America/Los_Angeles"`, `"UTC"`,
`"America/New_York"`). DR_EVT does not currently validate the name itself.

**Default:** `America/Los_Angeles`

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --timezone "America/New_York"
```

Embedded numeric offsets are recognized but currently have a known conversion
limitation when the configured timezone is not UTC. See
[Timezone Support](../dev/design-decisions/TIMEZONE_SUPPORT.md) before using
offset-bearing input.

### `-M, --msec_output`

Write timestamps in the simulated-job and resource traces with millisecond
precision instead of truncating them to integer seconds.

**Default:** Disabled

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --msec_output
```

## Simulation Mode Options

### `-r, --run_time_mode MODE`
How to determine the job's actual, observed execution length in simulation mode.

**Options:**
- `actual` - Read the job's finite actual run time from the input trace
  (default); the value must not exceed `time_limit`
- `distribution` - Sample from statistical distribution (realistic with variation)
- `limit` - Jobs run exactly their time_limit (unrealistic, for debugging only)

**Default:** `actual`

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --run_time_mode distribution
```

### `-D, --run_time_distribution TYPE`
Statistical distribution for run time sampling (when `--run_time_mode distribution`).

**Options:**
- `normal` - Normal (Gaussian) distribution (default)
- `lognormal` - Log-normal distribution
- `uniform` - Uniform distribution

**Default:** `normal`

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --run_time_mode distribution \
    --run_time_distribution lognormal
```

### `-S, --run_time_scale FACTOR`
Scale factor for job run times.

**Range:** > 0.0

**Default:** 1.0 (100% of time_limit)

**Example:** Jobs run 80% of their time_limit on average:
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --run_time_mode distribution \
    --run_time_scale 0.8
```

### `-V, --run_time_stddev FACTOR`
Standard deviation for run time distribution.

**Range:** >= 0.0

**Default:** 0.0 (no variation)

**Example:** 10% standard deviation:
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --run_time_mode distribution \
    --run_time_scale 0.9 \
    --run_time_stddev 0.1
```

## Limit Options

### `-j, --max_jobs COUNT`
Maximum number of jobs to simulate.

**Default:** Unlimited (process all jobs in trace)

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --max_jobs 100
```

### `-t, --max_time TIME`
Stop a batch run at the nonnegative numeric simulation timestamp `TIME`.
Events exactly at `TIME` are processed; events after it are not. Jobs still
running or waiting at the boundary remain in that state. The simulated-job
output contains only jobs completed through the boundary.

`TIME` uses the same numeric time coordinate as the trace. It is an absolute
timestamp on that coordinate, not a duration relative to `--sim_start_time`.
When warm start is enabled, `TIME` must therefore be greater than or equal to
`--sim_start_time`.

**Default:** Unlimited (run until all jobs complete)

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --timestamp_format epoch --max_time 3600.0
```

### `-s, --seed VALUE`
Random number generator seed for reproducibility.

**Default:** `0` (deterministic)

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --seed 42
```

## Configuration File Option

### `-c, --config CONFIGFILE`
Load parameters from a Protobuf `.textproto` configuration file.

**Requires:** Simulator built with `-DDR_EVT_ENABLE_PROTOBUF=ON`

Options are applied in command-line order. When `--config` is encountered,
the config file is loaded at that point; command-line arguments appearing
after `--config` override the corresponding config values.

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv \
    --config config.textproto \
    --total_nodes 200  # Overrides config file value
```

For the full `.textproto` schema, worked examples (including how to set
`queue_impl`/`wait_queue_capacity`/`wait_queue_overflow`/`job_store_capacity` this way),
and common configuration patterns, see
[Protobuf Configuration](protobuf-config.md).

## Debug Options

### `-v, --verbose`
Enable verbose output for debugging.

**Output includes:**
- Simulation progress
- Scheduling decisions
- Resource usage
- Job state transitions

**Example:**
```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator traces/jobs.csv --verbose
```

### `-h, --help`
Display help message with all options.

```bash
${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/simulator --help
```
